# Bidirectional-RNN-based-poem-generator
The Bidirectional RNN-based Poem Generator is an innovative natural language processing (NLP) project designed to generate expressive and contextually rich poems. 

The project harnesses the bidirectional nature of RNNs, allowing the model to consider both preceding and succeeding words in a sequence. 
This bidirectionality enhances the contextual understanding and coherence of generated poems.
